# Udemy-OpenGL-Course

This coursework demonstates a knowledge of the following:
* The creation of 3D graphical applications using C++ and OpenGL
* GLEW and GLFW
* Drawing 3D objects to a window
* OpenGL shaders (vertex, fragment and geometry shaders)
* Uniform variables
* The GLM (OpenGL Maths) library for 3D transforms
* The Translation, Rotation and Scaling of 3D objects
* The use of interpolation to streamline 3D applications
* Indexed Draws for the simplification of 3D model construction
* Orthogonal and perspective projections
* The implemention of a user controlled camera to navigate 3D worlds using keyboard and mouse input
* The application of textures to 3D models to give them more detail
* The application of the Phong Lighting model to add realistic lighting to a 3D scene
* The use of three types of light: Direction, Point and Spot Lights (and have multiple Point/Spot Lights in a scene!)
* Importing 3D models made in external applications such as Blender and 3DSMax using the Assimp library
* Applying both Directional Shadows and Omnidirectional Shadows
* Shadow Mapping optimisation techniques
* How to apply multiple Omnidirectional Shadow sources to a scene
* Implementing a Skybox to increase the scope of a 3D scene using cubemaps
